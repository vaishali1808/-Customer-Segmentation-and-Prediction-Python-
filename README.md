This project performs end-to-end customer segmentation and premium prediction using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
It analyzes a customer dataset containing demographic information, income, insurance policy details, and purchase history. 
The workflow includes exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, K-Means clustering, predictive modeling, evaluation, and insight generation.

Project Overview :-
Companies often struggle to understand their diverse customer base and target them effectively. This project solves that problem by:
✔️ Cleaning and preparing customer data
✔️ Engineering meaningful features
✔️ Segmenting customers using K-Means clustering
✔️ Predicting premium amounts using Linear Regression
✔️ Evaluating model performance
✔️ Extracting actionable marketing insights
Each script builds on the previous one, forming a complete analytical pipeline.

Conclusion :-
This project delivers a complete, end-to-end customer segmentation and premium prediction pipeline that transforms raw customer data into actionable business intelligence. 
By combining data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, and predictive modeling, the workflow uncovers meaningful customer groups and identifies the key factors influencing premium spending.

K-Means clustering successfully segmented customers into four distinct groups with unique characteristics, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized communication. 
The Linear Regression model further provided insight into how demographic and policy-related features—especially income and cluster membership—impact premium amounts. Model evaluation using RMSE and R² confirmed the predictive reliability of the approach.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data science techniques can enhance customer understanding, improve decision-making, and support strategic planning.
It serves as a strong foundation for building advanced personalization systems, retention strategies, and revenue optimization models in customer-centric industries such as insurance, banking, and retail.
